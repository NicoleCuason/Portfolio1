              <p>Hi there!</p>
              <p>
                My name is Nicole Cuason, and I’m currently a student at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). Ever since I was young, I’ve been deeply passionate about the arts, computers, and music. That love for creative expression and technology has stayed with me over the years, shaping both my personal interests and academic pursuits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, I’m enrolled in the New Media Design and Web Development program at BCIT. It’s been an incredible journey that’s not only sharpened my technical abilities but also allowed me to explore and expand my creativity in the digital space. The program offers a rich blend of design, development, and user experience, which has helped me grow into a more versatile and thoughtful digital creator.
              </p>
              <p>
                My foundation in design began early with manual drafting and rendering, which taught me to pay attention to detail and understand how visual elements come together. These early experiences were essential in helping me grasp core design principles and develop a keen eye for aesthetics. Over time, I’ve built on that foundation through hands-on experience in graphic design, UX/UI design, coding, and working with platforms like WordPress. These skills have equipped me to design and build websites that are both visually engaging and user-friendly.
              </p>
              <p>I’m especially passionate about working with digital tools because they give me the freedom to experiment and bring ideas to life in a hands-on, interactive way. Whether it's wireframing a user journey or diving into code, I love the challenge of blending logic and creativity to solve problems and tell stories through design.</p>
              <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing the piano. Music has always been a big part of my life—it’s a creative outlet that keeps me balanced and inspired. Taking time to play helps me recharge and often brings a fresh perspective to my design projects.</p>

                <p>
                  <strong class="value-title">Perseverance</strong> - As for perseverance, I always commit myself to work hard until I achieve my goals patiently, despite the challenges. But I wouldn't even give up until I succeed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <strong class="value-title">Accountability</strong> - It is normal for everybody to make mistakes, but this would be helpful for them to learn their responsibility based on their actions. Even I sometimes make mistakes, but I manage to solve the cases to become more responsible in the future, especially without being told by others. This helps me grow and build credibility.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <strong class="value-title">Courage</strong> - Experiencing failure is inevitable, but it serves as a stepping stone to growth. Although I've faced failures in the past, each one has helped me grow tougher. As a beginner, I didn't expect perfection. But when I look back and see how far I've come, it's clear that my past failures have played a key role in building my strength and progress.
